# UE4SUMO
A game for a school project. The game is at it's core going to be a simple 3D isometric game with low-poly art style. You play as a character that wants to eat all the food in the store and has to avoid enemies to reach that goal.
We are at early stages of production and hopefully, will reach our final destination within 2 months.
